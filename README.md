# square-tap

A game where you tap the squares if they appear orange, otherwise you lose hearts.
Keep in mind, I am not an expert at this. 


Here are the Technologies/Languages I Used:

a. HTML
b. CSS
c. JavaScript 
d. JQuery (A JS Library I guess?)
e. Canva (For the Images)


The rules of the game are simple:

1. Tap the square that appears orange to increase score.
2. Avoid tapping the gray squares as much as you can.
3. If you tap 1 grey square, you lose hearts.
4. If you tapped 3 grey squares, that is game over.
5. But most important of all, have fun!
